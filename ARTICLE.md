## Interesting Website
Here is the website I find interesting, which is about [the evolution of software developer salaries](https://codesubmit.io/blog/the-evolution-of-developer-salaries/).

 This website has some meaningful industry statistics for software engineering and software development. As in the provided statistic, we see a **significantly lower increment** - even a stagnation - in the mean annual pay of software developers and programmers than previous decades. Looking at the broader future trend, the author asserts that "industry experts expect low-level coding and programming jobs to become obsolete", which is kind of interesting as we now see the uprising of LLM such as ChatGPT and Gemini doing most of the easy, repetitive jobs for software development.
